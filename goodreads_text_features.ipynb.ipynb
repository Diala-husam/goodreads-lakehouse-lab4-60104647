proportioned and included nicely each character was well built up but then came the aspects of the weird or supernatural which i found mostly obscure and for some reason just didn t sit well with me for most of the book they are peppered in which is okay ish but then towards the end it s all sort of thrown at you and becomes very unbelievable yes i know the paranormal is unbelievable but in a book you want it to suck you in and make you believe in a world where devils witches vampires or whatever supernatural being may be involved is real i found the ending was a little rushed and sloppy sorry and i didn t have that feeling of satisfaction that normally comes after reading a book normally i am a huge fan of karina halle and i wish this book sat better with me i am sure some people will read this book and love it because it does underneath everything have a good and original story line and characters you want to empathize with overall i would give this a number number number its not terrible but it isn t something i would read again</td><td>0.261</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.678</td><td>0.9956</td></tr><tr><td>i loved the idea of reading the book through ethan s words usually we

really more of a number number than number stars and sadly i was rather bored for the most part the romance didn t blow me away kyle and paul weren t exactly my favorite couple i guess i hate leaving negative reviews and this isn t so much a negative review than me just not enjoying it i didn t feel like there was much of a story and the characters didn t save it for me this time i m afraid for me it s always all about the characters and well i wasn t blown away in that department either i adored kyle especially during the first number he s a lovely guy with a big big heart and a nice amount of attitude and character he was a little too smug though at times and i never got why he liked paul so much because really paul was nothing special at all not that the characters should be a certain way extremely fancy or super interesting with extreme hobbies and unusual talents but they should be charming and paul was just boring and acted more number than his number i just didn t appreciate him as much as i wanted and with the slow unfolding story it simply didn t keep me entertained many thanks to the publisher for providing a copy of this book in exchange for an honest and impartial review</td><td>0.235</td><td>0.067</td><td>0.698</td><td>0.9877</td></tr><tr><td>oh this book was just so fun i got talked into reading it after bookshelves of doom did an entire week devoted to the

cadfael mysteries i wish i d tried it sooner i was really struck by how much amelia peabody shares with alexia tarabotti from the parasol protectorate books i have to wonder if gail carriger has read this series i m not suggesting anything negative here certainly the parasol protectorate series stands apart but the two characters do share many basic characteristics even a penchant for carrying around a deadly parasol the characters are fun and endearing the time period setting is fascinating and the mystery brought in just enough intrigue and peril that it kept me up at night to read more i

         "the reviews on the jacket said it was a book to read in one sitting - i didn't manage that, but i did read it in two sittings - one night for \"inside\" and one night for \"outside\". \n as i was reading the story inside the room, i found myself wondering how on earth the author was going to sustain a whole novel in such a small space - but in fact the escape, which i'd known had to happen at some point, occurred about halfway through. once it did happen, i found the second half of the book less satisfying, as jack and ma struggle to adjust to the outside world again. \n i don't spend much time with five-year-olds so i have no idea whether jack's speech and thoughts are true to that age or not, all i can say is that i was totally convinced.",

         "sydney chandler choose to leave home, to give up her family and most of all to leave the love of her life simon behind. he broke her heart, he made his choice now she had to make hers. she chose herself. she left it all and started her life anew. she never really left simon though he was always in her heart. the love she felt for him from their childhood never diminished. when fate throws them back into each other's sights can sydney forgive and forget? can simon prove to her he's worth the risk? \n my review - 4 stars \n this story is about sidney chandler and simon mcallister and the love they built when they were very young growing up together. somehow along the way tragedy had simon making a tough decision that tore at him for years. the plot takes us through the story of how fate gives two young lovers a second chance to get it right. ten years after simon broke sidney's heart fate brings then together and simon will stop at nothing to win sidney's trust and her heart. i loved how simon did everything he could to get sidney to notice him, to get her to see how he never forgot their connection. he knows her better than she knows herself. he has never truly let her out of his sight, watching her from a far keeping her safe and waiting for the day they could finally be together. \n i absolutely loved the character of simon and the fact that he was a triplet made him all the more appealing. three hot alpha males to love and adore. i very much enjoyed the banter between the three chandler sisters and the three mcallister brothers. lots of sexual tension, a little less heat then i am used to in the books i read but when the sex scenes come they are well written and steamy. \n something happened to simon and sidney that the author hints at it seems everyone else remembers the accident but sidney has blocked it out a bit. that part of the story confused me a little there were some holes in the story but there are four more books so i am sure the author will piece it all together. this one ends in a bit of a cliffhanger. all the books in the series are out so no waiting you can get the whole story all at once. \n received an arc in exchange for an honest review.",

         "I haven't read a fun mystery book in a while and not sure I've ever read Poirot. Was looking for a fun read set in France while I was on holiday there and this didn't disappoint! Fast paced and good mystery. \n One that struck me was how similar Poirot is to Sherlock. They are both detectives, have a ex-military sidekick who is telling the story, and solve mysteries using their superior wit. Poirot seems like a French Sherlock. I'm curious if he was inspired by Sherlock.",

         "This is a special book. It started slow for about the first third, then in the middle third it started to get interesting, then the last third blew my mind. This is what I love about good science fiction - it pushes your thinking about where things can go. \n It is a 2015 Hugo winner, and translated from its original Chinese, which made it interesting in just a different way from most things I've read. For instance the intermixing of Chinese revolutionary history - how they kept accusing people of being \"reactionaries\", etc. \n It is a book about science, and aliens. The science described in the book is impressive - its a book grounded in physics and pretty accurate as far as I could tell. Though when it got to folding protons into 8 dimensions I think he was just making stuff up - interesting to think about though. \n But what would happen if our SETI stations received a message - if we found someone was out there - and the person monitoring and answering the signal on our side was disillusioned? That part of the book was a bit dark - I would like to think human reaction to discovering alien civilization that is hostile would be more like Enders Game where we would band together. \n I did like how the book unveiled the Trisolaran culture through the game. It was a smart way to build empathy with them and also understand what they've gone through across so many centuries. And who know a 3 body problem was an unsolvable math problem? But I still don't get who made the game - maybe that will come in the next book. \n I loved this quote: \n \"In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists? How many neutrons and electrons? Probably no fewer than a hundred million. Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos. In fact, even in nature, the destruction of universes must be happening at every second--for example, through the decay of neutrons. Also, a high-energy cosmic ray entering the atmosphere may destroy thousands of such miniature universes....\"",

         "Mind blowingly cool. Best science fiction I've read in some time. I just loved all the descriptions of the society of the future - how they lived in trees, the notion of owning property or even getting married was gone. How every surface was a screen. \n The undulations of how society responds to the Trisolaran threat seem surprising to me. Maybe its more the Chinese perspective, but I wouldn't have thought the ETO would exist in book 1, and I wouldn't have thought people would get so over-confident in our primitive fleet's chances given you have to think that with superior science they would have weapons - and defenses - that would just be as rifles to arrows once were. \n But the moment when Luo Ji won as a wallfacer was just too cool. I may have actually done a fist pump. Though by the way, if the Dark Forest theory is right - and I see no reason why it wouldn't be - we as a society should probably stop broadcasting so much signal out into the universe.",

         "Fun, fast paced, and disturbing tale of murder. Great beach read while in France, which is where its set. \n I enjoyed learning more about perfume and the power of scent - hearing the descriptions of how different kinds of scents are captured (distilled, oils, etc) was very interesting. I think in general we (certainly I) don't pay much attention to the power that scent holds over us in different situations. I will pay more attention now after reading this. Though I wish I had a stronger nose - curious if there are ways to cultivate that. My wife and I once bought a game at a wine store that had 30 different materials that they use in wine and you had to guess what they were. I think I got 3 out of 30 right :( \n This was a dark and twisted book though be forewarned - I generally don't like reading first person accounts of murderers - but in this case it was gripping. And the climax (yes that was a pun) was so ridiculous and fun that it was worth it.",
